# Additional information:

The original code is download from  python wrapper for C++ code on github https://github.com/hrldcpr/pyLAPJV.
LAPJV comes from the paper:

R. Jonker and A. Volgenant, "A Shortest Augmenting Path Algorithm for Dense and Sparse Linear Assignment Problems," Computing, vol. 38, pp. 325-340, 1987.

According to that paper, it is notably faster than the Hungarian algorithm (a.k.a. Munkres' algorithm) and several other linear assignment algorithms.
